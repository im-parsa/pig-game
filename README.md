## :question: About:
**Pig Game** is a free game made for you to spend free time. The rules are simple:

- Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- The game ends when a player gets 100 points.
